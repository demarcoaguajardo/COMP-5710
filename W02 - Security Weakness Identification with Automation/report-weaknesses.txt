There were 44 security weaknesses that I discovered.

These include:

B101 - Use of assert detected (30 cases)
B311 - Random blacklist (7 cases)
B404 - Import_subprocess blacklist (1 case)
B403 - Import_pickle blacklist (1 case)
B301 - Pickle blacklist (1 case)
B603 - Subprocess without shells equals true (2 cases)
B607 - Start process with partial path (1 case)
B110 - Try except pass (1 case)

Therefore, the three most frequent security weaknesses were:

1. B101 - Use of assert detected
2. B311 - Random blacklist
3. B603 - Subprocess without shells equals true
