When first running "cue vet w5.yaml check.cue", I got the ouptut:

-   "max: invalid value 1 (out of bound >5):
    ./check.cue:2:16
    ./w5.yaml: 3:6"

    -   This indicated that my first max value was less than the first
        min value, so I changed it to 10 so that it would be > 5.

When running the CUE command for the second time, I got the output:

-   "max: invalid value 5 (out of bound >10):
    ./check.cue:2:16
    ./w5.yam1:6:6"

    -   This indicated that the second max value was less than the second
        min value, so I changed it to 15 so that it would be > 10.

When running the CUE command for the third time, I got the output:

-   "config3: invalid value -30 (out of bound >=10):
        ./check. cue: 5:20
        ./w5.yaml:12:10
    config4: invalid value 10 (out of bound <2):
        ./check.cue:6:20
        ./w5.yam1:13:10"

    -   This indicated that config3 was less than the third max, so
        I changed config3 to 11 so that it would be >= 10.

    -   It also indicated that config4 was greater than or equal to config2,
        so I changed config4 to 1 so that it would be < 2. 

When running the CUE command for the fourth time, I got no output, thus
all the errors detected by CUE were no longer.
