After getting the total for each category, the three most frequent security misconfigurations
as determined by SLI-KUBE were the following:

NO_NETWORK_POLICY (Count 37): The misconfiguration category that is related with not specifying
network policies. Without specifying network policies Kubernetes installations are susceptible
to unauthorized accesses.

NO_ROLLING_UPDATE (Count 10): The misconfiguration category that is related with not explicitly
specifying RollingUpdate in the configuration file. A lack of rolling updates makes a Kubernetes
installation susceptible to supply chain related attacks.

INSECURE_HTTP (Count 10): The category of using HTTP without SSL/TLS certificates to setup URLs
or transmit traffic inside and outside the Kubernetes clusters. Without SSL/TLS certificates,
the data transmitted across Kubernetes objects are susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
